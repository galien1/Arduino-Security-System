# Arduino-Security-System
Hello and welcome to the README of Arduino-Security-System
This was made as a fun project to record movement detected and how far away it is detected.
To see the output you will hae to go into Serial Monitor mode on your Arduino software!
If you exit out of the Serial Monitor All logs are lost and cannot be retreived :C We will be working on this problem in our next versions.
