# Arduino-Security-System V 1.0
Hello and welcome to the README of Arduino-Security-System
This was made as a fun project to record movement detected and how far away it is detected.
To see the output you will have to go into Serial Monitor mode on your Arduino software!
If you exit out of the Serial Monitor All logs are lost and cannot be retreived :C We will be working on this problem in our next versions.

# Arduino-Security-System V 2.0
Hello and welcome to the README of Arduino-Security-System
This was made as a fun project to record movement detected and how far away it is detected.
* To see the output you will have to go into Serial Monitor mode on your Arduino software!
* If you exit out of the Serial Monitor All logs are lost and cannot be retreived therefore you will have to transfer all your logs onto a excel spreadsheet.
## Features of V 2.0:
* The light will profusely until movement is detected will the light turn to a solid red!
* All mesurements are written to the Serial Monitor!
